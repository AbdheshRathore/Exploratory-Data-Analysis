# Weather Forecasting – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical weather data to understand climate patterns, seasonal trends, and relationships between key weather variables. The analysis helps uncover insights that can support weather forecasting modeling.

## Objectives

Understand historical weather patterns and trends
Analyze relationships between temperature, Solar, Ozon, and wind speed
Identify seasonal variations and extreme weather conditions
Prepare a clean dataset for future forecasting models

## Tools & Technologies

Python,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
Google colabe

## Dataset

Historical weather data (CSV format)
Contains features such as:

Temperature,
Wind,
Solar,
Date & Time,
Ozon,
Weather .

## Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the weather dataset and its underlying patterns. Initial data inspection revealed minor missing values and inconsistencies, which were successfully handled during the data cleaning phase, resulting in a reliable and analysis-ready dataset.

Univariate analysis highlighted the distribution and variability of key weather parameters such as temperature, Ozon,Solar and wind speed. These variables exhibited clear seasonal behavior, particularly in temperature and Ozon patterns.

For Bivariate and multivariate analysis we use pairplot Visualization techniques it revealed meaningful relationships among weather variables. A strong correlation was observed between Ozon and Temp.

Overall, the EDA process transformed raw weather data into structured insights, confirming that the dataset is well-suited for further analytical tasks. The findings establish a solid foundation for applying predictive modeling techniques to estimate future weather conditions.
